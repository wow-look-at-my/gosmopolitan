// A build is not one process. A test suite starts thousands of go commands a
// minute. Each one opens this directory for itself: its own index writes, its
// own trim, its own connection to the store, and its own exit held open while
// it drains its own uploads.
//
// One process owns the cache instead. It is the first go command of the build,
// and it serves the others over a unix socket. A child holds no DiskCache at
// all: it asks for an action and gets back the identity of a file this process
// has already written, which it then opens.
//
// That leaves one writer for the directory, so the trim has a single owner and
// the invariant Cache.Close describes is enforceable rather than hoped for.
